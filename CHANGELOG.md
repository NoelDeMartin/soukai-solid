# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2020-07-17

### Added

- New `SolidDocument` model.
- Helper methods in relation instances. [Read the docs](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid#relations) to learn more.
- `loadSolidModels` method to `SoukaiSolid` instance (the default export of the library). This should be called to load models defined by `soukai-solid`.
- Support for storing multiple models in a single document. [Read the docs](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/tree/v0.3.0#hasmany) and see [SolidModel.test.ts](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/blob/v0.3.0/src/models/SolidModel.test.ts) for examples.

### Changed

- `soukai` dependency has been updated to 0.3.0.
- Replaced `rdflib` dependency with `jsonld-streaming-parser`, `jsonld-streaming-serializer` and `n3`.
- Extracted container functionality to `SolidContainerModel`, container models should extend this class.
- Refactored engine document format generated by `SolidModel`, they now generate JSON-LD graphs. Data stored with engines other than `SolidEngine` needs to be migrated in the upgrade or the application will stop working. [Read the docs](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/tree/v0.3.0#solid-models-vs-solid-documents) for the reasons behind this refactor.
- `SolidModel` class is now abstract (it should always have been).

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/releases/tag/v0.2.1) - 2019-12-01

### Fixed

- A bug where using urls of missing resources within a `$in` filter would throw an error.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2019-08-05

### Added

- Support for features introduced in Soukai 0.2.0 (relationships and filters).
- `resourceUrls` implicit field to containers.
- `mintsUrls` static property on `SolidModel` to disable url minting of new models.

### Changed

- `soukai` dependency has been updated to 0.2.0.
- `solid-auth-client` dependency has been removed, the `SolidEngine` constructor now takes a function to interact with Solid PODs.
- License changed from GPL to MIT ([read this](https://noeldemartin.com/tasks/improving-solid-focus-task-manager#comment-9) to learn why).
- `SolidModel` attributes are now converted to JSON-LD before being sent to engines, this is related with a refactor on Soukai 0.2.0 where models have been decoupled from engines.
- Some methods and arguments have changed, be sure to check out the new [type definitions](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/tree/v0.2.0/types).

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/NoelDeMartin/soukai-solid/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2019-03-23

### Added

- Everything!
